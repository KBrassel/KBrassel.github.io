					[Skyrim opens with an Imperial wagon driving four prisoners down a snowy
					mountain pass. All are seated and bound; the one dressed in finery is gagged.]
					<br><br>Ralof: Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
					right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
					thief over there.
					<br><br>Lokir: D**n you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was
					nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen
					that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we
					should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
					<br><br>Ralof: We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
					<br><br>Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!
					<br><br>[Lokir looks at the gagged man.]
					<br><br>Lokir: And what's wrong with him?
					<br><br>Ralof: Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High
					King.
					<br><br>Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if
					they captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?
					<br><br>Ralof: I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.
					<br><br>Lokir: No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.
					<br><br>Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?
					<br><br>Lokir: Why do you care?
					<br><br>Ralof: A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.
					<br><br>Lokir: Rorikstead. I'm...I'm from Rorikstead.
					<br><br>[They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.]
					<br><br>Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!
					<br><br>General Tullius: Good. Let's get this over with.
					<br><br>Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.
					<br><br>Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like
					the Thalmor are with him. D**n elves. I bet they had something to do
					with this.This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod
					is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny...when I
					was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.
					<br><br>[A man and son watch the prisoners pull into town.]
					<br><br>Haming: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?
					<br><br>Torolf: You need to go inside, little cub.
					<br><br>Haming: Why? I want to watch the soldiers.
					<br><br>Torolf: Inside the house. Now.
